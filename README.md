# TrueTender Portfolio Project

## Project Purpose

TrueTender started as a final assignment for the Tech Elevator Part-time Java Bootcamp. With that being said, it includes a minor amount of starter code that was written by instructors at Tech Elevator such as the authentication and authentication testing that is built into the project. The purpose of this project is to continue to develop new skills in java, SQL, and vue.js as well as to demonstrate skills acquired along the way. 

## Project Description

TrueTender is a web application built with a Java backend, a SQL database, a vue.js frontend, and a RESTful API.

TrueTender's function is a playlist tracker. It allows authenicated users to add, edit, and delete songs from the playlist. It allows users to add, edit, and delete genres as well. 

## Goals For TrueTender

The main goal for TrueTender going forward is to add an embedded YouTube video player that will allow the user to click on a song in the application and play the music video.
